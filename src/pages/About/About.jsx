            with new people and pushing limits - hackathons turn ideas into

            Many engineering students{" "}

              never hear about hackathons
            </span>{" "}
            happening in their cities. The big platforms{" "}
            <span className="highlight orange">Devfolio, Unstop</span> focus on
            their own events, but what about the countless college-hosted
            hackathons? They remain{" "}
            <span className="highlight orange">undiscovered</span> and students
            miss out.

          <h2>I faced this problem too</h2>
          <p>
            When I started, I had no idea where to find hackathons. I had to{" "}
            search through{" "}
            <span className="highlight red">
              websites, WhatsApp groups and random social media posts
            </span>
            . After winning two hackathons, I realized: there needs to be a
            <span className="highlight red">simple, all-in-one place</span> for
            students to explore and plan hackathons.

          <p>
            Hackathons have given me so much - learning fast, collaborating with

            <span className="highlight blue">Cosmic</span>, handling deadlines
            and expressing ideas. I‚Äôve seen{" "}

            and now, I want to help more students experience this journey.
