### Purpose 

I built this platform out of love for Hackathons, because our team had won 3 national-level Hackathons and many batchmates kept asking **"Where do you find these Hackathons?"**

To save time and effort for students, I created this project which **curates top Hackathons from popular platforms like `Unstop`, `Devfolio`, `DoraHacks`**, etc into one place.
